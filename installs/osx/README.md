# Building from source on Mac OS X

## Prerequisites
First of all, you must install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) by executing:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

Also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) from: https://git-scm.com/download/mac

And finally, you should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) from : https://brew.sh/

Note: Homebrew is not required to generate eXe packages, but is used for simplicity on installing its prerequisites.


## Python environment preparation
Py2app won't create a standalone app if you use the default version of Python shipped with OS X, so you need to install a new one in order to be able to do it.

The easiest way of doing this is by using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

Install it by executing:

```console
$ brew install pyenv
```

Install Python 2.7 by executing:

```console
$ env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework" pyenv install 2.7.13
$ pyenv shell 2.7.13
$ easy_install pip
```

#### Note
This should be done only once. For future builds of eXe you should only have to execute the following command to use the new Python environment:

```console
$ pyenv shell 2.7.13
```

## Python modules installation
Once you have the new Python environment setup, you must install all the required packages:

```console
$ pip install py2app
$ pip install --trusted-host www.pythonware.com --find-links http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ Imaging
$ pip install zope.interface
$ pip install libxml2
$ pip install chardet
$ pip install gitpython
$ pip install lxml==2.2.8
$ pip install suds
$ pip install requests-oauthlib
$ pip install python-dateutil
$ pip install httplib2
$ pip install BeautifulSoup
$ pip install feedparser
$ pip install oauthlib
$ pip install webassets
$ pip install cssmin
$ pip install python-dateutil
```

#### Important note!
You should at least version 0.14 of py2app installed for eXe to work properly.

## Empty image creation
In order to build a .dmg image for distribution you will have to create a new empty disk image.

Open Disk utility and create a new image with the following options:
* Save as: exe
* Where: installs/osx/
* Name: exe
* Size: 500 MB
* Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled)
* Encryption: None
* Partitions: Single partition - GUID Partition Map
* Image format: read/write disk image

## Code download
Once you have all the requirements set up, you have to download the source code. There is two methods to this:

1. Using **GIT** (You must have *git* installed in your system):

	First you have to navigate to the folder you want the source code to download into. And then you have to execute this command:
	```console
	$ git clone https://github.com/exelearning/iteexe.git
	```

2. Downloading a **ZIP file** with the source code:

	You can do this by going to the [GitHub homepage of this project](https://github.com/exelearning/iteexe), pressing on *Clone or download* and then on *Download ZIP*. Unzip the file in your desired folder.

## Package generation
With everything ready, the only thing left to do is to generate the package. For this you simply have to execute the following commands:

```console
$ cd installs/osx
$ python make.py -p
```

#### Note
If you don't want to create a .dmg image, you can build only the App by removing the "-p" argument like this:

```console
$ python make.py
```
